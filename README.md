# My Fedora Linux set up (Since I majorly use GitHub for backing up) 

Whenever I get a new machine, I'll have a bunch of files and scripts to get my desktop environment set to my custom needs and preferences as fast as possible.

If you want to, you can run these scripts above to set your Fedora and use the desktop env I use.

P.S: It might work for any Unix-based operating system, but some bash commands in this repo assume you're using a RedHat based linux distribution.
