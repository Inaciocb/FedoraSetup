##My Fedora Linux set up (Since I majorly use GitHub for backing up)

Whenever I get a new machine, I'll have a bunch of files and scripts to get my desktop environment set to my custom needs and preferences.

If want to, you can run these scripts above to make your Fedora the way mine is.

P.S: It may work for any Unix-based operating system, but some bash commands in this repo (such as 'dnf') assume that you're on a RedHat based linux distribution.
